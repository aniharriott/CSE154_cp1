    <h1>About My Art</h1>
    <p>
      Over the course of this year I've spent more time investing in myself
      and my own art style. Though I haven't nailed it down yet, I've moved
      away from the more accessible mediums of drawing and painting, and more
      towards different sculpture techniques. I've been experimenting with
      different mediums including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clay</li>
      <li>Found Objects</li>
      <li>Cardboard</li>
      <li>Fabric</li>
      <li>Collage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I began to rekindle my interest in the arts when I took an Honors course
      in the fall about publication and exhibition. Following that I took
      the intro to sculpture course, and I'm now taking intermediate sculpture.
      I'm looking forawrd to exploring more techniques this quarter in wood working,
      metal working, and casting, as well as develop more of my own style and
      direction in my creation. Some of my more current works are what I've showcased here.
